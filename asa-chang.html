            Wednesday, October 23rd at 8pm, AvanTokyo and ISSUE Project Room are pleased to present esteemed
            Japanese band ASA-CHANG & Junray for their debut U.S. performance. Drawing on material
            from the project’s entire discography, they perform as a trio: ASA-CHANG (percussion),
            Yoshihiro Goseki (saxophone, flute), Sena Oshima (violin), and the “Junray Tronics”
            soundsystem. The evening will take place at The Invisible Dog Art Center, and will also
            feature Argentinian experimental artist Alma Laprida whose creative pursuits encompass
            composition, improvisation, performance, installation, and radiophonic pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
            ASA-CHANG & Junray is the name of the ASA-CHANG experience, and comes from the
            “Junray Tronics” soundsystem developed by self-taught tabla guru Asa-Chang. Junray (derived
            from the Japanese word for “pilgrimage”) has been described as an attempt to summarize
            musically the entire experience of human emotion, or “kidoairaku.” Based in Tokyo, Asa-Chang
            has spent much of his professional life touring with multi-million-selling J-pop acts and is
            regarded as one of Japan’s premiere session percussionists. In the early 2000s, his group was
            met with worldwide acclaim from the success of debut international album Tsu Gi Ne Pu and the
            single “Hana,” a revelry of tabla, overlapping vocals, strings, and electronic elaborations that
            stands as an achievement of early-aughts innovation between pop and avant-garde
            sensibilities. BBC DJ and tastemaker John Peel had featured the single regularly on his radio
            show; and, even recently, they have garnered new admirers, with German concert series
            ReiheM describing the song’s pointed impartiality as in the spirit of Robert Ashley or David
            Behrman. ASA-CHANG & Junray’s expression lives beyond both country and culture. Amid
            COVID-19, many of the group's shows were postponed, including a commemorative concert
            scheduled last year in honor of the 20th anniversary release of their influential song, "Hana."
            Following major changes to their lives over the past three years, the members are overflowing
            with passion as they resume long overdue live performances.
        </p>

            Deriving from a similar vein of experimentation as ASA-CHANG, Alma Laprida weaves complex
            sampling techniques into her line of improvised work. The multidisciplinary artist relocated to the
            U.S. in 2021 from her home in Buenos Aires with her tromba marina or “marine trumpet.” This
            unique medieval European string instrument was used until the baroque era, and then
            practically abandoned. Through improvisation, using a custom made two-string marine trumpet
            and electronic processing, Laprida focuses on repetitive gestures that unfold out of minimal
            changes and allow audiences to discover the timbres and overtones of this largely unknown
            instrument. For her solo set, the tromba marina will be amplified by a self-made contact mic and
            then processed by pedals. The evening will also feature elements from her work “Japan,” an
            electronic piece created for BICHA (analogic sounding circuit by Jorge Crowe), which was
            commissioned by The Toy Lab.
