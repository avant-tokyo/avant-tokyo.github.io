            At the apex of Japan’s miracle “bubble” economy in 1990, a new broadcasting company named St. Giga put forth
            a utopian vision for radio programming, envisioning a new direction for the world of media as mankind drew
            close to the 21st century. Conceived by creative director Hiroshi Yokoi (横井宏) after his success establishing
            the legendary terrestrial J-Wave station in Tokyo, St. Giga followed a radically new set of principles: no
            commercials, no DJs, no news and a seamless flow of audiophile-quality digital sound, using a
            subscription-based model for long-form environmental home listening that re-oriented the relationship
            between listener and transmitter — what Yokoi envisioned as the radio model of the future. “We are about to
            enter a period of major historical change not often witnessed in the history of mankind,” Yokoi wrote in
            Dream Tide (夢の潮流), the station’s wide-eyed programming manifesto. “I believe that people involved in media
            have an important obligation to fulfill - that is to truly grasp the spirit of this period.”
        </p>
        <p>
            On September 27th & 28th AvanTokyo and Public Records proudly honor this legacy and presents the first ever iteration of
            St. GIGA anywhere outside of Japan in the form of a two-night event in the Sound Room. In close
            collaboration with Visible Cloaks, our team has programmed these nights to sojourn through the tones and
            textures that made St.GIGA so astounding. On both nights, Visible Cloaks is honored to welcome the two
            artists with whom they’ve collaborated on the acclaimed serenitatem record (RVNG intl.) and who were vital
            in St. GIGA’s existence and narrative. First, the prolific Japanese producer/composer Yoshio Ojima, who was
            an influence on the station through his content and programming contributions and has been exploring the
            spaces between ambient and natural sounds for decades. Alongside Ojima will be fellow atmospheric explorer
            and a renowned interpreter of Erik Satie, the pianist and composer Satsuki Shibano who often contributed her
            voice to the poetry readings of the station. Night one will also feature Brooklyn musician and
            multi-instrumentalist and Commend NYC affiliate, Strugglin’, on the lineup, as well as a pre-show artist
            conversation moderated by artist/writer/editor Sadie Starnes. Night two will feature the classically trained
            sound artist UCC Harlo additionally on the lineup with an afterparty featuring DJ Healthy.

        Limited tickets will be sold at the door.
